Implementation of a CVA valuation based on finmath-lib.

This project implements a CVA valuation dropping the assumption of independence between default and payoff.
Two approaches are used. First the intensity based approach and second a constrained worst case approach.

The excel sheets located in the ObbaExcelSheets folder allow for a CVA valuation of a bond and a swap. 

Steps to use the excel sheets:
1.) Install Excel
2.) Install the Obba for Excel http://obba.info/documentation/installation/
3.) Clone this repository 

After the previous steps you can run the the excel files located in ObbaExcelSheets.
